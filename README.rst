UPnP Schema
===========

This is a separate library for UPnP schema.
It contains standard and reusable schema.

Custom schema may be imported from the application or another Component.
Create a ``schema`` sub-directory and arrange as::

   schema/
      {domain}/
         device/
            ...
         service/
            ...

Suitable schema are generated by the UPnP scan tool.
These may be edited and customised with additional detail, comments, etc.
as required.
